  <h1>JobTrack - Final Project Writeup</h1>

  <div class="team-details">
    <h2>Team Details</h2>
    <p><strong>Team Name:</strong> JobTrack</p>
    <p><strong>Team Members:</strong> Xavier Yin (jy963)</p>
    <p><strong>Deployed Project URL:</strong> <a href="https://jobgenie-six.vercel.app" target="_blank">https://jobgenie-six.vercel.app</a></p>

  <h2>Project Idea</h2>
  <p>
    JobTrack is a comprehensive job application tracking system designed to help job seekers organize and monitor their job search process. 
    The application allows users to track job applications across different stages (Applied, Interviewing, Offer, Rejected), 
    upload and manage application-related documents, and view a detailed timeline of status changes for each job. 
    The goal is to provide job seekers with a centralized platform to streamline their job search efforts and maintain 
    better visibility into their application progress.

  <h2>Starter Code</h2>
  <p>The project was built from scratch using Next.js as the primary framework. No specific starter templates were used beyond the initial Next.js project setup.</p>

  <h2>Technology Choices</h2>
  <div class="tech-list">
    <div class="tech-item">Next.js</div>
    <div class="tech-item">React</div>
    <div class="tech-item">Tailwind CSS</div>
    <div class="tech-item">MongoDB</div>
    <div class="tech-item">NextAuth.js</div>
    <div class="tech-item">@hello-pangea/dnd</div>
    <div class="tech-item">Vercel</div>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Frontend:</strong> The application uses Next.js for server-side rendering and API routes, with React for component-based UI development. 
    Tailwind CSS was chosen for styling due to its utility-first approach and ease of creating responsive designs. 
    The @hello-pangea/dnd library provides the drag-and-drop functionality for the job board interface.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Backend:</strong> MongoDB was selected as the database solution for its flexibility with document-based data structures 
    and seamless integration with Next.js. NextAuth.js handles authentication and session management, providing a secure 
    and straightforward way to implement user accounts.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Deployment:</strong> The application is deployed on Vercel, which offers excellent integration with Next.js applications 
    and provides continuous deployment capabilities. MongoDB Atlas serves as the cloud-hosted database service.
  </p>

  <h2>Learnings</h2>
  
  <div class="challenges">
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>MongoDB Schema Design:</strong> Designing the relationships between job applications and their status history required careful planning 
        to ensure efficient queries and data integrity. Creating appropriate MongoDB models and ensuring proper references between collections 
        was particularly challenging.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Drag and Drop Implementation:</strong> Implementing the drag-and-drop functionality for the job board was more complex than anticipated, 
        especially ensuring that the backend properly updated when jobs were moved between columns. The status update functionality needed 
        special attention to maintain data consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>File Upload System:</strong> Building a secure file upload system with proper validation and storage was challenging, particularly 
        in ensuring files were properly associated with the correct user accounts. Managing file storage and retrieval while maintaining 
        security was non-trivial.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Authentication Integration:</strong> Integrating NextAuth.js with MongoDB and ensuring proper user data isolation required careful 
        implementation of middleware and session management. Ensuring that each user could only access their own data was critical for security.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>MongoDB Atlas Connectivity with Vercel:</strong> Getting the deployed application to connect to MongoDB Atlas required configuration 
        of the IP whitelist to allow Vercel's dynamic IP addresses, which was not immediately obvious.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  
  <div class="challenges">
    <h3>Unexpected Ease</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Vercel Deployment:</strong> The deployment process with Vercel was surprisingly straightforward, with excellent integration 
        for Next.js applications. The ability to automatically deploy on code pushes made the development workflow much smoother.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tailwind CSS:</strong> Using Tailwind significantly accelerated the UI development process and made responsive design much easier 
        than anticipated. The utility-first approach was particularly effective for building a consistent UI.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Next.js API Routes:</strong> The API route system in Next.js made it straightforward to create the necessary backend endpoints without 
        setting up a separate server. The file-based routing structure was intuitive and helped organize the code effectively.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
